1) We Can Create Constants Using Static Keyword.

2) There are 2 types of Data Types. Primitive and Non-Primitive
Primitive Data Types:These are predefined data types 
byte,int,float,long,short,boolean,char;
Non Primitive:-These are developer defined data types.
String is an example of non primitive data type.

3)Specifying data type is mandatory inorder to allocate a specific memory location. i.e each datatype has a predefined memory.
   we Specify the datatype withrespect to the value passed.

5)Variable Initiliztion is a process of declaring a variable and passing a value/literals to the varibale.
  Where as assigning is declaring a variable and then paasing the value onthe next linee;
  
  Syntax of initialization:- dataType variableName=literal;
             Exmaple:- int number=123; 
			 
             Exmaple of assigning  :String name;
			                        name="Pratheek";

4)it should start with a lowercase and the next word should start with an uppercase
Ex:- nameOfStudent;
or it can use an Underscore
Ex:- name_Of_Student;

6)Array isa sequence which stores multiple values in it.
ex: int[] array={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10};

7)No.Index value can never be a negative number.

8)Array is Stored in  a Constant pool.

9)We can pass multiple values intoan array;
  can be used to retrive a specific value from the specified index;

 15) If you do not initalize an array the file will be compiled but during execution it points to the memory location.
     Because whenever we declare a variable there will be a memory allocated to it in the constant pool and whenever we pass 
	 the value it gets stored in the constant pool.

17)Static Keywors:-Static keyword means it belongs to  a speific type itself we cannot create multiple instances of it.
   It might be a variable name or a method.
   Static variable:-It means the variable is constant and cannot be changed.
   Static method :the static method canbe called only once and cannot be called multiple times like an instance.
   
18)No we cannot overload or override a static method.

19)

20)Whenever the static block is called the static method gets executed first.

21)no a Constructor cannot be static in java.

23)Constructor chaining is used to connect different methods using this keyword.

24)Constructor is used to create multiple instance of an class .new keyword is used to create an instance.

26)We can call a sub class from a super class using extends keyword.It is a process of inheritance
   ex: subclass extends superclass

27)we can create instance of a child class within parent class using new.
    ex ParentClass parentclass=new ChildClass();
	
28)Class is aBlueprint to create objects whereas instance is a property of a class

29)instance of a class can be created by calling a Constructor.
